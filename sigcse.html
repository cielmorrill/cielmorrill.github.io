    It is important to be capable of recieving critical feedback in order to further improve; humans are imperfect, and although this means peer judgement may also be flawed, the value of outside perspectives should not be overlooked. That being said, when it is those in high positions of power that are given executive control of judgement, the role is often abused. The situation yields to oppression rather than advancement; rather than a collaborative environment, it is elitist, exclusionary, and intolerant.

    This article was published in October 2022, suggesting that the pandemic was still at least somewhat prevalent.

    For those who are underrepresented in STEM, it is critical that they can be linked to resources and support that allows them access to the same opportunities as those with inherent systematic benefits. Early school years are critical in terms of development, and when it comes to subjects as integrated in the modern world as Computer Science, diversity is indisputably essential. Although someone may not have the same qualifications as those from a privileged background, it does not mean the candidate is less qualified - instead, it may point to lack of equal opportunities to prove their qualifications.

    The way unfounded grammatical critiques were used to undermine the actual intent of the proposal are a clear example of how barriers to diversity have been implemented and enforced. It deviates time and energy away from progression, instead focusing it on discriminatory challenges to validity.
    <br><br>
    <b>It is clear that there are systematic issues and prejudices barring certain groups of people from entering STEM fields - specifically Computer Science. In a manner that is plainly discriminatory, they may be required to prove their capabilities - or even the worthiness of their presence in the field - while peers are left unchallenged. </b>
