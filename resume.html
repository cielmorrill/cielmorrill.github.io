    <h2>
      Personal Statement
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      I have a background in computer science. I was the <b>TA for AP Java</b> during Covid, which required me to be adaptable while providing support to those around me. I was also a <b>private Python tutor</b>, where I was personally responsible for developing the course, explaining the material, working through any questions, and overcoming challenges.
<br><br>
In addition, I have spent a large portion of time working <b>customer service</b>. In these jobs, I proved my proficiency at <b>multitasking</b>, by maintaining an upbeat attitude and working around issues, such as item shortages, without sacrificing efficiency. I also contributed to a positive work environment and made the most of working as a team. I am capable of handling <b>intense situations</b> and I am equipped with the ability to stay <b>organized</b>.
<br><br>
Finally, I’m both <b>detail-oriented</b> and I have a <b>love for learning</b>. I have taught myself multiple <b>foreign languages</b>, and was able to achieve fluency in Spanish within a year, as well as the foundations of Japanese. I led a Girls Who Code club at my school, as well as sharing the presidency of the Computer Science club. I want to not only improve my skills, but also improve the lives of others in the process. I am confident that I will learn quickly, and that I will ensure my work is executed accurately and with precision.
