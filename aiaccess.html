    - AI allowing for neurodivergent accessibility is extremely promising, especially pertaining to academic environments. The organization of school systems has long catered to select learning styles, despite the vast amounts of variation in the ways humans process information.
  <br><br>
    - InnerVoice in particular has the potential to create a considerably more equitable manner of accessing knowledge. As a phone app, it offers a fair amound of convenience, and offers crucial support for those in early stages of development and beyond. 
  <br><br>
   - Personally, I believe the intimidation factor of information overload to be the one of the most major culprits of procrastination - or, worse, it leads to avoidance of the situation altogether. In the same way that reading textbook passages prior to class may lead to additional understanding of the material, the use of abstraction provides an opportunity to better adjust to new information before putting it to use.
  <br><br>
    - Diversity comes in many forms. In the same way that the variation of view points leads to a better-rounded product, allowing for space to exist for those outside the neurotypical sphere is beneficial for all involved.
