    Video Game Hairstyles
  </h1>

  <p>
    As someone with curly hair, I can affirm from my own experience how difficult it is to good representation - or
    any representation, for that matter - of my curl type. Sure, there are a lot of different curl patterns, but in
    many games, everything is catered entirely towards straight and wavy hair. Whenever I'm given the option to create
    my own avatar, I'm unable to get close to replicating something that is one of my most defining physical
    characteristics, and it's always rather disappointing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I think it's crucial to acknowledge that when it comes to black hair, it's not only that styles like locs, bantu
    knots, and twists are missing - but that the many additional styles that can be done are also non-existent. There
    is so much expression that is being ignored, which is clearly displayed in many modelled options that exist for
    straighter hair types.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I also think it's interesting that many games with modding scenes solve, or at the very least ameliorate this
    issue (specifically, lack of hair diversity). People are willing to pour in time and effort in order to ensure
    that representation exists in a suitable manner - it's not like we're lacking the technology to properly implement
    anything. It's just not viewed as a matter of importance.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I've read many articles in the past that detailed discrimination against those with "classically black hair" due
    to the idea that it was unprofessional. Even in this day and age, many face challenges in scenarios like the
    workplace of white collar jobs due to stigmatization and sterotypes rooted into society.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I've played Pokemon games for a long time - I remember being so disappointed when Scarlet came out and the options
    still hadn't been updated, even after all the push on social media for better inclusivity. I've also played a lot
    of Animal Crossing - which still doesn't have great options for avatar creation - and the tanning mechanic used to
    be a lot more severe in past games. For example, the darkest skin tone avaliable from tanning in City Folk is
    considerably darker than the one depicted in New Leaf.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I think this video does a very good job of explaining just why diversity is so crucial in work environments. There
    are perspectives that simply will not be represented if there is not space for them - and that's not a minor
    issue.
  </p>

    <b>The problem is not as simple as "more black hairstyles would be nice". It's important to look at the big picture: the history, the sheer prevalence of this issue, and overall lack of representation. </b>
